# Python-Command-Line
A python program that can run command line commands

# Usage and install
This program requires no install as it is written in Python. You only need to have Python installed. App was made and tester only using [Python 3.11.5](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.5/python-3.11.5-amd64.exe). This app should be able to be used with older or newer versions depending on the [3.11.5 Release Notes](https://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/3.11.html). Stable versions are released as a package through GitHub. Cloning the repository gives latest builds but it's not garanteed it will work.
