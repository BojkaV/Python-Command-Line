# Release Naming

When you go to download a release you will find that each one has a unique discription. In this file we are going to tell you what all of this means.

## Status

Status is the current status of the release. A release can be Unverified Alpha, Alpha, Unverified Beta, Beta, Unverified Release, Release. Alpha, Beta and Release are decided by the team, depending on the status of the project. A package gets verified if 1 week after its release it doesnt have any issues. If a issue is found the 1 week timer resets. In that time the release is Unverified

## Version

Basically the verson of the release. For example Alpha 3 or Unverified Beta 2. When a release that has an unverified status gets a patch it adds a SubVersion to the Version. For example Release 1.3.
